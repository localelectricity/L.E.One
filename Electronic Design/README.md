A device which allows users to harvest power from anything that generates electricity, whether it is a solar panel or an electric motor from an old washing machine. The device turns the unregulated voltage from these devices into useful electricity, which can then be used to charge mobile phones or provide lighting.

The device also provides users with feedback on how a particular generation device is performing through a simpl UI.
